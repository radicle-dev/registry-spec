\section{Transactions}
\label{s:transactions}

All transactions on the registry take the form $\tx{transaction}{arg_1, \ldots,
arg_n}$, where $arg_1, \ldots arg_n$ are the \emph{inputs} and $\sigma$ is the
\textsf{EdDSA} signature of the author of the transaction. Transactions always
have an \emph{author} and an \emph{origin} (formally $\alpha$), which is the
author's account.

Transactions can be uniquely identified by their \emph{hash}. The set of all
\emph{known} transactions is $\txs$ (the ``ledger''), and the set of all known
transaction hashes is $\field{\txs}{hash}$.

\section{Accounts}
An account $A$ is a tuple:
\[
    A = \tuple{\field{A}{id}, \field{A}{nonce}, \field{A}{bal}}
\]

\spec{
    \definition
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{A}{id}$ is the unique account identifier obtained by hashing
            the account owner's public key,
        \item $\field{A}{nonce}$ is a number which starts at $0$ and is incremented
            every time a transaction originates from this account.
        \item $\field{A}{bal}$ is the account's balance in the smallest denomination,
            and $\field{A}{bal} \in \nat_{\geq 0}$.
    \end{itemize}}
The set of all accounts is $\accounts$. Accounts are never created or destroyed,
rather, if they have never been used to transact, they have an initial state of:
\[
    A = \tuple{\field{A}{id}, 0, 0}
\]
Hence, for all valid account ids, there exists an account with that id. In other
words, $\forall a \in \field{A}{id} (A \in \accounts)$.

Note that accounts can \emph{never be removed}, since that would violate the
invariant that nonces are only ever incremented, and removing an account is
equivalent to setting $\field{A}{nonce}$ and $\field{A}{bal}$ to $0$.

\subsection{Root accounts}
Some accounts are considered \emph{privileged}. These `root' accounts,
formally $\root \subset \accounts$ are authorized to conduct certain transactions
that are only valid when originating from these accounts.

The set of accounts in $\root$ is defined at \emph{genesis}, and may not be
further modified in the initial protocol.

\subsection{Transferring value}
The act of transferring coins between two accounts:
\[
    \tx{transfer}{\field{A}{id}, v}
\]
which will transfer value from the transaction origin $\alpha$ to account $A$.

\spec{
    \inputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{A}{id}$ is the account id of the \emph{receiver} of the transfer,
        \item $v$ is the value or `balance' to transfer from the origin to the receiver,
            in the smallest denomination.
    \end{itemize}

    \validation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The transfer balance is positive, or $v \geq 1$,
        \item The origin's balance minus any transaction fee is $\geq v$.
    \end{itemize}
    \outputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $v$ is debited from the origin and credited to $A$.
    \end{itemize}
}

\section{Projects}
A project $P$ is a tuple:
\[
    P = \tuple{\field{P}{id}, \field{P}{k}, \field{P}{account},
        \field{P}{contract}, \field{P}{proof}, \field{P}{meta}}
\]

\spec{
    \definition
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{P}{id}$ is the unique project identifier, defined as
            $\tuple{\field{P}{name}, \field{P}{domain}}$,
        \item $\field{P}{k}$ is the current project \emph{checkpoint} (See \S\ref{s:checkpoint}),
        \item $\field{P}{account}$ is the project account or \emph{fund},
        \item $\field{P}{contract}$ is the project contract, which governs
            permissions around the project, as well as its fund. It can be
            described as a function:
            \[
                f : \txs \to \mathcal{O}
            \]
            where $\txs$ is any known transaction, and $\mathcal{O}$ is the
            function's codomain described by:
            \[
                \{\top, \bot\} \cup [\distribution] \cup \nat.
            \]
            An output in $\{\top, \bot\}$ is reserved for \emph{boolean} contracts,
            where $\top$ signifies a transaction $t \in \txs$ is
            \emph{authorized} to execute by the contract, and $\bot$ means it
            is \emph{unauthorized}.  Note that a transaction can be verified
            and included in the transaction ledger $\txs$ yet still be
            unauthorized to run.

            An output in $[\distribution]$ is reserved for transactions
            that should trigger a distribution of funds to one or more
            contract-specified beneficiaries, where $\field{A}{id}$ is the
            account of one of the beneficiaries, and $\nat$ is the value to
            transfer.

            An output in $\nat$ is reserved for transactions that should
            trigger a transfer of funds to an a priori \emph{known} beneficiary
            that shouldn't be determined by the contract. For example, the transaction
            origin.
        \item $\field{P}{proof}$ is the proof that was supplied during registration,
            verifying the owner's authority over the project,
        \item $\field{P}{meta}$ is a dictionary of additional metadata to associate
            with the project, for example the \radicle{} \emph{project id}.
            $\field{P}{meta}$ is \emph{immutable} once defined.
    \end{itemize}}
Projects are created with the \textsf{register-project} transaction.  The set
of all projects is $\projects$.

\subsection{Project registration}
The act of registering a project under a unique name and domain:
\[
    \tx{register-project}{\field{P}{id}, \field{P}{k}, \field{P}{contract},
        \field{P}{proof}, \field{P}{meta}}
\]
This transaction requires a deposit $\deposit{register-project}$.

\spec{
\inputs
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\field{P}{id} = \tuple{\field{P}{name}, \field{P}{domain}}$
    \item $\field{P}{name}$ is the unique name being requested, where
    \item $\field{P}{domain}$ is the domain under which $\field{P}{name}$ is
        being registered, which together form the unique identifier
        $\field{P}{id}$,
    \item $\field{P}{k}$ is the id of the initial \emph{checkpoint} associated
        with this project, formally $k_0$. This checkpoint must always remain
        in the project ancestry,
    \item $\field{P}{contract}$ is the initial project contract that includes
        the initial permission set around the project,
    \item $\field{P}{proof}$ is a byte array of up to 4096 bytes supplied to
        prove the legitimacy of this project registration,
    \item $\field{P}{meta}$ is a dictionary of metadata to be associated with
        $P$. For example, identities on other platforms. Note that once submitted,
        the metadata is immutable.
\end{itemize}
\validation
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\field{P}{name}$ must be unique, \ie not currently registered under
        $\field{P}{domain}$, between $1$ and $32$ characters long, and valid
        \textsf{UTF-8},
    \item $\field{P}{domain}$ must be an existing domain,
    \item $\field{P}{k}$ must represent an existing checkpoint,
    \item $\alpha_{bal} \geq \deposit{register-project}$.
\end{itemize}
\outputs
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P \in \pending$, where $\pending$ is the set of registrations that
        are in a ``pending'' state, waiting to be accepted or rejected (See
        \S\ref{s:accepting-projects}). Note that $\pending$ and $\projects$
        are disjoint,
    \item $\alpha_{bal'} = \alpha_{bal} - \deposit{register-project}$.
\end{itemize}}

\subsection{Accepting and rejecting a project}
\label{s:accepting-projects}
The act of accepting or rejecting a project being registered:
\[
    \tx{accept-project}{\field{t}{hash}}
\]
or
\[
    \tx{reject-project}{\field{t}{hash}}
\]

\inputs
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\field{t}{hash}$ is the \emph{transaction hash} of the
        \textsf{register-project} transaction $t$ of a project $P$
        being accepted or rejected.
\end{itemize}
\validation
\begin{itemize}
    \item The transaction \emph{origin} is a member of $\root$,
    \item $\field{t}{hash}$ must be the hash of an existing transaction of
        type \textsf{register-project}. In other words, $P \in \pending$,
        where $P$ is the project being registered.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent For \textsf{accept-project},
\newline\outputs
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P \in \projects$
    \item $P \notin \pending$
    \item $\field{P}{account} = \tuple{\field{A}{id}, 0, 0}$
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\noindent For \textsf{reject-project},
\newline\outputs
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P \notin \projects$
    \item $P \notin \pending$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project registration withdrawal}
It's possible to withdraw a project from registration if it hasn't been
accepted or rejected yet with:
\[
    \tx{withdraw-project}{\field{t}{hash}}
\]

\spec{
    \inputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{t}{hash}$ is the transaction hash of the \textsf{register-project}
            transaction $t$ for some project $P$ that should be withdrawn.
    \end{itemize}
    \validation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P \in \pending$
    \end{itemize}
    \outputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P \notin \pending$
    \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Checkpointing}
\label{s:checkpoint}
The act of notarizing a project's state and updating the network graph:
\[
    \tx{checkpoint}{\field{K}{parent}, \field{K}{hash}, \field{K}{version},
    \field{K}{contribs}, \field{K}{deps}}
\]
Checkpoints within the scope of a single project form a chain going from the
latest, or ``current'' checkpoint $k_{n-1}$ to the first and original
checkpoint $k_0$. Checkpoints are identified by their transaction hash,
so $k \in \field{T}{hash}$.

From the perspective of $k_0$, we can talk of a checkpoint \emph{tree}, since
due to their nature, they are able to represent branching. Hence, the original
checkpoint $k_0$ is also called the \emph{root} checkpoint.

\inputs
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\field{K}{parent}$ is the \emph{id} of the previous or `parent' checkpoint,
    \item $\field{K}{hash}$ is the new hash of the project state,
    \item $\field{K}{version}$ is the current version of the project,
    \item $\field{K}{contribs}$ is the list of contributions since $\field{K}{parent}$,
    \item $\field{K}{deps}$ is the list of dependency updates since the $\field{K}{parent}$.
\end{itemize}
\validation
\begin{itemize}
    \item{$\field{K}{parent}$ refers to an existing checkpoint in the registry,
        or is $\varnothing$.}
    \item{$\field{K}{hash}$ is a valid hash that hasn't been used in a parent
        checkpoint.}
    \item{$\field{K}{version}$ is a string between $1$ and $32$ bytes long that
        \emph{may} have been used in a previous project checkpoint.}
    \item{$\field{K}{contribs}$ is a valid contribution list (See \S
        \ref{s:checkpoint-contribs}).}
    \item{$\field{K}{deps}$ is a valid dependency update list (See \S
        \ref{s:checkpoint-deps}).}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Contributions}
\label{s:checkpoint-contribs}
The list $\field{K}{contribs}$ supplied to the $\mathsf{checkpoint}$
transaction is of the form:

\[
    \field{K}{contribs} = [\tuple{\field{C}{parent}, \field{C}{hash},
    \field{C}{author}, \field{C}{sig}}],
\]

\spec{
    \definition
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{C}{parent}$ is the hash of the parent contribution, or
            $\varnothing$ if this is the first contribution of the first checkpoint
            of the project.
        \item $\field{C}{hash}$ is the hash of the corresponding commit,
        \item $\field{C}{author}$ is the public signing key of the commit referred
            to by $C$,
        \item $\field{C}{sig}$ is the author's \textsf{GPG} signature.
    \end{itemize}
    \validation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{C}{parent}$ is a valid \textsf{SHA-1} hash or
            $\varnothing$ if this is the first contribution. Note that if $C$
            is $\field{K}{contribs}$'s first item, and $C'$ is the \emph{last}
            item of the \emph{parent} checkpoint's contributions list, then
            $\field{C'}{hash}$ and $\field{C}{parent}$ must be equal, such that
            no gaps between contributions exist.

        \item $\field{C}{hash}$ is a valid \textsf{SHA-1} hash,
        \item $\field{C}{author}$ is the creator of $\field{C}{sig}$,
        \item $\field{C}{sig}$ is a valid signature of $\field{C}{hash}$.
    \end{itemize}
}
Because all changes to a project's source code are described in checkpoints, it
is possible to reconstruct a full hash-linked list of contributions for the
entire project. When cross-referenced with the project's repository, this
constitutes a complete historical record of who authored what code. This
ensures the project history is auditable and tamper-proof, while providing
fundamental information to for the network graph $\netgraph$. Note that only
contribution \emph{metadata} is stored on-chain.

\subsubsection{Dependency updates}
\label{s:checkpoint-deps}
Conceptually, a project $P$ depends on another project $P'$ if it is an
``input'' to $P$ in some way: $P$ references $P'$ or parts of $P'$ in its
source code, or $P'$ is a build/test dependency.

The dependency update list $\field{P}{deps}$ is a list of \emph{dependency
  updates}, one of:
\[
    \begin{cases}
        \depend(\field{P'}{id}, \field{P'}{version}) \\
        \undepend(\field{P'}{id}, \field{P'}{version})
    \end{cases}
\]
which refer to the project $P'$ at a specific version $\field{P'}{version}$.
The $\depend$ update adds a new dependency while the $\undepend$ update removes
a dependency. The updates are processed in order with $\depend$ only being
valid if it adds a dependency that the project does not already have and
$\undepend$ only being valid for current dependencies. The checkpoint is
invalid if the update list contains duplicates.

% NOTE: Should the checkpoints include the hash of the project being depended
% on? This would add another check for projects registering.

\bigskip
\validation
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\field{P'}{id}$ must be a valid project id, but \emph{does not}
        have to refer to an existing id in the registry. This allows dependent
        projects to checkpoint dependencies that have not yet been registered.
    \item $\field{P'}{version}$ must be a valid version string, but \emph{does not}
        have to refer to an existing version of $P'$. This allows dependent projects
        to checkpoint before their dependencies.
\end{itemize}
As a project maintainer, adding a dependency signals a variety of things
depending of the nature of the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item They have verified that $P$ indeed depends on this specific
  version of $P'$.
\item That $P'$ is suitable as a dependency for $P$, \eg{} if $P$ has
  very high security requirements, that $P'$ fulfills these.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Since contributions to a project carry additional
weight---potentially increasing a project's rank---there is an incentive
for maintainers to checkpoint their projects regularly.  Similarly, adding
dependencies may increase connectivity in the network graph, which may in turn
indirectly improve a project's rank.

\subsection{Setting the project checkpoint}
The act of updating the project to point to a new checkpoint:
\[
    \tx{set-checkpoint}{\field{P}{id}, k'}
\]
which updates $\field{P}{checkpoint}$ from $k$ to $k'$.

\spec{
    \inputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{P}{id}$ is the id of the project being updated,
        \item $k'$ is the id of the checkpoint the project
            should be associated to.
    \end{itemize}
    \validation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{P}{id}$ refers to a project that has been accepted
            in the registry,
        \item $k'$ is a checkpoint which has the original project checkpoint
            $k_0$ in its ancestry.
        \item $\field{P}{contract}(\txmsg{set-checkpoint}{\field{P}{id}, k'}) \equiv \top$
    \end{itemize}
    \outputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{P}{k} = k'$
    \end{itemize}}
Note that the semantics of this transaction allows for projects to revert to
a previous checkpoint, or to adopt a ``fork'', as long as the new checkpoint
shares part of its ancestry with the previous checkpoint.

\subsection{Updating the project contract}
The act of updating a project's contract:
\[
    \tx{set-contract}{\field{P}{id}, c}
\]

\spec{
    \inputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{P}{id}$ is the id of the project,
        \item $c$ is the new contract.
    \end{itemize}
    \validation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P \in \projects$,
        \item $\field{P}{contract}(\txmsg{set-contract}{\field{P}{id}, c}) \equiv \top$
    \end{itemize}
    \outputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{P}{contract} = c$
    \end{itemize}}

\section{Names}

\subsection{Registering a domain}
The act of registering a top-level domain:
\[
    \tx{register-domain}{domain}
\]
\inputs
\begin{itemize}
    \item $domain$ is the unique domain being registered.
\end{itemize}
\validation
\begin{itemize}
    \item The transaction origin $\alpha$ is a member of $\root$,
    \item $domain$ must be available for registration, between $1$ and $32$
        characters long, and valid \textsf{UTF-8}.
\end{itemize}
For example,
\[
    \tx{register-domain}{\mathtt{crates}}
\]

\section{Identity}

\subsection{Identifying as a contributor}
The act of identifying yourself as a contributor, by linking a public key used
to sign project contributions, to an account in the registry:
\[
    \tx{identify}{\field{I}{pk}, \field{I}{proof}}
\]

\spec{
    \inputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{I}{pk}$ is the public key that is to be associated with
            the \emph{origin} account $\alpha$ if this transaction succeeds.
        \item $\field{I}{proof}$ is a proof verifying that the transaction
            author owns $\field{I}{pk}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \validation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{I}{pk}$ is not already associated with an account,
        \item $\field{I}{proof}$ is $\alpha_{id}$ signed by the secret key $sk$ that
            $\field{I}{pk}$ was derived from. In other words,
            \[
                \field{I}{proof} = \mathsf{encrypt(hash(\alpha_{id}), \mathit{sk})}
            \]
            which is valid if
            \[
                \mathsf{decrypt}(\field{I}{proof}, \field{I}{pk}) \equiv
                    \mathsf{hash(\alpha_{id})}
            \]
    \end{itemize}}

\subsection{Forgetting identities}
When a public key associated with the \textsf{identify} transaction is lost or no
longer used, the following transaction will `forget' the association:
\[
    \tx{forget}{\field{I}{pk}}
\]

\appendix
\section*{Appendix}

\subsection*{Alternative contribution model}
It's possible to drastically reduce the size of checkpoints by merkleizing the commit
history and making contribution claiming an explicit action on the part of
the contributor.

First, we change the checkpoint transaction's $\field{K}{contribs}$ argument from a \emph{list}
of commits to a single \emph{hash}. This hash is the Merkle root of the commit list
that was $\field{K}{contribs}$, with $\tuple{\field{C}{hash}, \field{C}{author}, \field{C}{sig}}$ at each leaf:
% TODO: Is `C_{author}` actually required?
\[
    \field{K}{contribs} = \operatorname{\mathsf{hash}}(
        [\tuple{\field{C}{hash}, \field{C}{author}, \field{C}{sig}}]
    ),
\]
where \textsf{hash} is a Merkle hash function. $\field{K}{contribs}$ is
now constant-sized. Note that in this alternative model, $\field{C}{parent}$ is
no longer used, since it can't be verified.

Then, we ask contributors to claim contributions if they wish to receive rewards, with
a new \textsf{claim-contribution} transaction:
\[
    \tx{claim-contribution}{C_1 \dots C_n, \field{C}{proof}}
\]

\spec{
    \inputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $C_1 \dots C_n$ is the list of commits to claim, where $C =
            \tuple{\field{C}{hash}, \field{C}{sig}}$, and $\field{C}{author} =
            \alpha$, the author of the transaction. Note that $\field{C}{author}$
            is not actually included in the transaction, since it is assumed to always
            be $\alpha$.
        \item $\field{C}{proof}$ is the Merkle proof asserting that $C_1 \dots C_n$
            are included in the $\field{K}{contribs}$ set. It is expected that
            $\field{C}{proof}$ can use structural sharing to compress the Merkle paths
            such that the transaction does not grow linearly in $n$. Formally, each
            $\field{C}{proof}$ is an ordered set $\{\pi_1 \dots \pi_n\}$ of Merkle
            paths associated with $C_1 \dots C_n$.
    \end{itemize}
    \validation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\field{C}{proof}$ is valid if each path $\pi$ hashes to the same root
            hash $r$, and there is a checkpoint $K$ such that $\field{K}{contribs} = r$.
        \item For each $C \in C_1 \dots C_n$, $\field{C}{sig}$ is a signature by the
            author $\alpha$.
        % TODO: Explain how the proof is constructed?
    \end{itemize}
    \outputs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\alpha_{bal'} = \alpha_{bal} + v$, where $\alpha_{bal'}$ is the
            author's new account balance, and $v = \field{P}{contract}(t)$ where
            $t$ is the \textsf{claim-contribution} transaction.
    \end{itemize}
}
